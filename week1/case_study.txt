#Case Study: MakerDao Leader of Open Lending Protocols

##What Is It
MakerDao is a Decentralised Finance (Defi) credit platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Users will deposit digital assets into Maker Vaults through dapps like oasis and metamask. Once digital collateral is deposited in the Vault, the Maker Protocol will generate Dai, a stablecoin whose value is pegged to USD. 

MakerDao was created in 2014 but did not publish its whitepaper until December 2017. The whitepaper introduced the Dai Stablecoin System.

Rune Christensen was one of the founders of MakerDao. Still, the project continues to be developed by both the Maker Foundation and the Dai Foundation Trust Deed to safeguard what cannot be technologically safeguarded by the Maker Protocol.  

The founders of MakerDao were looking for a way to provide economic freedom and opportunity to anyone, anywhere. To do this, they created a system called  Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) that allows anyone to generate Dai by leveraging various digital assets that are approved by a community organisation called “Maker Governance”. This community votes and manages various aspects of the Maker Protocol. 

Dai is a decentralised, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency that is soft pegged to the US Dollar—used as a medium of exchange resistant to hyperinflation due to its low volatility.    

The company is funded through a Stability Fee. The Stability Fee is a fee paid by every Vault owner when debt is paid down or entirely paid off. This fee is based on an annual percentage yield calculated on top of the existing Vault debt. 

##Why This Matter

In 2008 the world experienced the Global Financial Crisis that led to a loss of more than $2 trillion on toxic assets and bad debts. These bad debts were issued by financial institutions who were incentivised to do so by lax lending regulations and generous monetary policies by central banks around the world.  

With the public’s growing frustration and distrust in centralised financial institutions, Blockchain technology started being used and, more specifically, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an unbiased, transparent and efficient system that improves the global financial system. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is very volatile due to its fixed supply, and this is not ideal when used as a medium of exchange. 

This is where the Dai stablecoin comes in because Dai is pegged to the US dollar. Therefore, this minimises price volatility and can be used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account in this new decentralised financial system.  

The main solutions Maker Dao offers its clients is through the Maker Protocol. The Maker Protocol gives users the ability to generate the Dai stablecoin, which will generate a yield on stored digital assets as well as a collateralised loan against these assets.

##Technologies

To achieve this, Maker Dao uses three leading technologies

-MakerDao Protocol
-MKR
-Ethereum Blockchain
-Smart Contracts
-Dai Stablecoin

###MakerDao Protocol

The Maker Protocol is designed for digital asset investors who would like to earn yield for their assets, such as Ethereum. Investors can gain a return from these assets without having to sell them through the Dai Savings Rate. 

MakerDao governs the Maker Protocol and is managed by people worldwide who hold the governance token, MKR.

###MKR

MKR tokens allow holders to vote on critical parameters of the Maker Protocol. For example, these parameters could be stability fees, collateral types. MKR voting is decided by weight and is proportional to the amount of MKR tokens a voter has staked in the voting contract.

###Ethereum Blockchain

The Ethereum Blockchain is a platform for distributed applications in a trustless, secure and decentralised environment. This blockchain allows developers to create applications that use smart contracts. MakerDao uses this technology to create smart contracts for the lending protocol as well as the voting.

###Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain, in this case, Ethereum. These programs are designed to run when predetermined conditions are met. In MakerDao and other lending protocols, these conditions are agreements between the users and the Maker Vaults, which agree to loan Dai, backed at agreed collateral, with an agreed rate. Also, conditions would be in place if the collateral price dropped and the loan was forced to be paid back through liquidation of the asset.

###Dai Stablecoin

The Dai stablecoin is the currency generated for investors for the deposited collateral in the Maker Vaults. Investors can then use Dai to use other cryptocurrencies for payment of goods, transfers to others or even save it through the Maker Protocol called the Dai Savings Rate.

##Why This May Be Interesting

MakerDao is an open lending protocol that is categorised in the Decentralized Finance (Defi) space. Open lending protocols provide users with instant settlement and integration with digital assets without the need for credit checks and financial institutions.  

In the last five years, the Defi industry has grown from virtually $0 to $73.1 billion in Total Value, making it a larger market cap than many old and established financial institutions like Westpac ($71.21) and Vanguard ($71.31)  

##Results

While MakerDao is still in its early days, it is considered one of the flagship projects of the Defi space. Currently, there is $12.36 Billion or 3.03 million ETH locked up in the Maker Vaults, which is an increase of 11.9 billion USD since this time last year. 

When measuring the success of a Defi project, the primary metric used is Locked USD or otherwise known as Total Value Locked (TVL). MakerDao is leading its closest competitors Aave and Compound by $1.22 and $2.72 billion, respectively and has total dominance of 16.42%
